  <h2>Welcome to our website!<br> We wanted to share with kids some information about different cultures. Especially during this time of covid and having to stay home. Unfortunately when kids stay home they are not exposed to other cultures. We think it is important to get a true experience to learn and explore through online websites and recources. Please enjoy!</h2>
